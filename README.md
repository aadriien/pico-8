# ðŸŽ®ðŸ‘¾ PICO-8 DevBuddy

## Description

A series of helpers and utilies designed to **improve the developer experience** on PICO-8!


### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x


## Features

### Modular programming with separate files
Tired of searching through your lengthy `.p8` file for snippets of code? Wish you could just break sections down into manageable chunks? `build-game.py` has you covered!

Simply run the following from your project directory:

```sh
# Clone the repository, then navigate to it
git clone https://github.com/aadriien/pico8-devbuddy.git
cd pico8-devbuddy

# Confirm .p8 file AND .lua files present at root, then run
ls
python3 build_game.py
```

`build_game.py` will find your `.p8` file, along with any / all `.lua` files. It will assemble the Lua code from each included module into one large block of code, which it will then inject into `.p8`. 

This build script will **ONLY rewrite the code section**, so you can rest assured that your PICO-8 **graphics and map data will remain untouched**. Put simply, you can update the core functionality and logical flow while still preserving game aesthetics.
